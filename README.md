# Modality exclusivity norms for 747 Dutch 747 properties and concepts in Dutch: a replication of English (Bernabeu, Louwerse, & Willems, in prep.)

This folder contains all experimental data, including each response survey in raw, the compilation of those alongside English norms data from Lynott and Connell (2009, 2013) (all.csv), the analysis code in R (norms.R), and the Dutch norms themselves (norms.xlsx).

**Abstract**

This study is a cross-linguistic, conceptual replication of Lynott and Connellâ€™s (2009, 2013) modality exclusivity norms. Their English properties and concepts were translated into Dutch, then independently tested as follows. Forty-two respondents rated the auditory, haptic, and visual strength of those words. Mean scores were then computed, with a high interrater reliability and interitem consistency. Based on the three modalities, each word also features a specific modality exclusivity, and a dominant modality. The norms also include external measures of word frequency, length, distinctiveness, age of acquisition, and known percentage. Starting with the results, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words appear. Visual and haptic experience are quite related, leaving a more independent auditory experience. These different relations are important because they may correlate with different levels of detail in word comprehension (Louwerse &amp; Connell, 2011). Auditory and visual words tend towards unimodality, whereas haptic words tend towards multimodality. Likewise, properties are more unimodal than concepts. Last, the 'sound symbolism' hypothesis was tested by means of a regression: Auditory strength predicts lexical properties of the words (frequency, distinctiveness...) better than the other modalities do, or else with a different polarity.
