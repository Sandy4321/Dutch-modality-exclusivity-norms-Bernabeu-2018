## Modality exclusivity norms for 747 Dutch properties and concepts in Dutch: a replication of English

This repository contains all experimental data, including each response survey in raw, the compilation of those alongside English norms data from Lynott and Connell (2009, 2013) (all.csv), the analysis code in R (norms.R), and the Dutch norms themselves (norms.xlsx).

These Dutch modality norms were created to facilitate research about language. On average, each word was rated by eight respondents, with a minimum of five and a maximum of nine respondents per word (overall *N* = 42). The [instructions](https://osf.io/ungey/) were similar to those in Lynott and Connell (2009, 2013), but three modalities were elicited instead of five.

> <span style = "font-size: 14px;"> 'This is a stimulus validation for a future experiment. The task is to rate how much you experience everyday' [properties/concepts] 'using three different perceptual senses: feeling by touch, hearing and seeing. Please rate every word on each of the three senses, from 0 (not experienced at all with that sense) to 5 (experienced greatly with that sense). If you do not know the meaning of a word, leave it blank.' </span>

These norms were validated in a conceptual modality switch experiment (below), which revealed that switches across trials with different dominant modalities (e.g., visual versus auditory) incurred semantic processing costs. Further analyses of the norms' data are due to be reported in a forthcoming paper.

**Abstract**

This study is a cross-linguistic, conceptual replication of Lynott and Connellâ€™s (2009, 2013) modality exclusivity norms. Their English properties and concepts were translated into Dutch, then independently tested as follows. Forty-two respondents rated the auditory, haptic, and visual strength of those words. Mean scores were then computed, with a high interrater reliability and interitem consistency. Based on the three modalities, each word also features a specific modality exclusivity, and a dominant modality. The norms also include external measures of word frequency, length, distinctiveness, age of acquisition, and known percentage. Starting with the results, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words appear. Visual and haptic experience are quite related, leaving a more independent auditory experience. These different relations are important because they may correlate with different levels of detail in word comprehension (Louwerse &amp; Connell, 2011). Auditory and visual words tend towards unimodality, whereas haptic words tend towards multimodality. Likewise, properties are more unimodal than concepts. Last, the 'sound symbolism' hypothesis was tested by means of a regression: Auditory strength predicts lexical properties of the words (frequency, distinctiveness...) better than the other modalities do, or else with a different polarity.

- Dominant modality: Highest-rated modality.

- Modality exclusivity: Range of the three modality ratings divided by the sum.

- Perceptual strength: Highest rating across modalities.
